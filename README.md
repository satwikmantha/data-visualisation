# data-visualisation

1. Introduction: The document starts with an overview of Matplotlib and Seaborn, explaining their purposes, features, and typical usage scenarios.

2. Code Examples: The tutorial includes several Python code snippets demonstrating how to create different types of plots using the Iris dataset. These examples cover:
   - General statistics plot using Seaborn's pairplot
   - Pie plot showing the frequency of Iris species
   - Scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and width
   - Distribution plots of sepal and petal features
   - Joint plot of sepal length vs sepal width
   - Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots for the Setosa species

3. Visualizations: The document includes several output images corresponding to the code examples, showing various ways to visualize the Iris dataset.

4. Structure: The tutorial is divided into multiple exercises, each focusing on a different type of visualization or aspect of the data.

5. Libraries Used: The code examples utilize pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for loading the Iris dataset.

6. Learning Progression: The exercises appear to progress from simpler plots (like pie charts) to more complex visualizations (like KDE plots), suggesting a structured learning approach.

This document serves as a practical guide for creating various types of data visualizations using Python, with a focus on exploring and presenting different aspects of the Iris dataset.
